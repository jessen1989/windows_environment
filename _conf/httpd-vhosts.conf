# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#

Include /srv/sites/apache/*.conf


#
#
#
# <VirtualHost *:80>
# 	DocumentRoot "/srv/sites"
# 	ServerName localhost
#
# 	AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .php
#
# 	ErrorLog "/srv/sites/apache/logs/error.log"
# 	CustomLog "/srv/sites/apache/logs/access.log" common
#
# 	<Directory /srv/sites>
# 		DirectoryIndex index.html index.php
# 		Options Indexes MultiViews
#
# 		Require all granted
# 	</Directory>
# </VirtualHost>
